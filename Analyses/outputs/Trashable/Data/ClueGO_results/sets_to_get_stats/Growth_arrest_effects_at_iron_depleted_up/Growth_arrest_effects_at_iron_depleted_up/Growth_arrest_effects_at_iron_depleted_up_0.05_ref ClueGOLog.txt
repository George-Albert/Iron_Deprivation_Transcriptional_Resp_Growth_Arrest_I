#Genes in custom reference set (C:\Users\34655\OneDrive\Desktop\reference.txt) : 2182
#All unique genes in selected ontologies: 2182 (reference set for hypergeometric test)

#Genes from Cluster#1: unique uploaded ids 1252 -> corresponding genes 1252, with 0 (0.0%) missing  -> All genes were recognized by ClueGO.
#Genes with functional annotations in all selected Ontologies from Cluster#1: 691 (55.19%) -> 561 (44.81%) are not functionally annotated in any selected Ontology!
 -> To improve the % of annotated genes, chose additional ontologies.

#Genes from all Clusters associated to 700 representative Terms and Pathways (after applying general selection criteria): 673 (53.75%)
#Genes from all Clusters associated to 437 representative Terms and Pathways (after fusion selection criteria): 667 (53.27%)
#Genes from all Clusters associated to 87 representative Terms and Pathways (after p-value significance selection criteria): 477 (38.1%)
