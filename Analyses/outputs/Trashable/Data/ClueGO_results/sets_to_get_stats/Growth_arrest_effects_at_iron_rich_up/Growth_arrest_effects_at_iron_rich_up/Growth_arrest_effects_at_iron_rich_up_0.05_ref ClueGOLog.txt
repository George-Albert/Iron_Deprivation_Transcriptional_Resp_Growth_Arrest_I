#Genes in custom reference set (C:\Users\34655\OneDrive\Desktop\reference.txt) : 2182
#All unique genes in selected ontologies: 2182 (reference set for hypergeometric test)

#Genes from Cluster#1: unique uploaded ids 1144 -> corresponding genes 1144, with 0 (0.0%) missing  -> All genes were recognized by ClueGO.
#Genes with functional annotations in all selected Ontologies from Cluster#1: 644 (56.29%) -> 500 (43.71%) are not functionally annotated in any selected Ontology!
 -> To improve the % of annotated genes, chose additional ontologies.

#Genes from all Clusters associated to 680 representative Terms and Pathways (after applying general selection criteria): 631 (55.16%)
#Genes from all Clusters associated to 418 representative Terms and Pathways (after fusion selection criteria): 626 (54.72%)
#Genes from all Clusters associated to 66 representative Terms and Pathways (after p-value significance selection criteria): 460 (40.21%)
