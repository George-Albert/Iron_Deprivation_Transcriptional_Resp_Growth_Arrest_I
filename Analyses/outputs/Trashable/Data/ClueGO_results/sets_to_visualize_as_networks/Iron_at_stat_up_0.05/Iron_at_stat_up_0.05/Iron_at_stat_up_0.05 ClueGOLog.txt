#Genes in custom reference set (C:\Users\34655\OneDrive\Desktop\DRY LAB\ClueGo_C5-C6_final\Sogol\reference.txt) : 2182
#All unique genes in selected ontologies: 2182 (reference set for hypergeometric test)

#Genes from Cluster#1: unique uploaded ids 452 -> corresponding genes 452, with 0 (0.0%) missing  -> All genes were recognized by ClueGO.
#Genes with functional annotations in all selected Ontologies from Cluster#1: 254 (56.19%) -> 198 (43.81%) are not functionally annotated in any selected Ontology!
 -> To improve the % of annotated genes, chose additional ontologies.
