#All unique genes in selected ontologies: 2182 (reference set for hypergeometric test)

#Genes from Cluster#1: unique uploaded ids 254 -> corresponding genes 254, with 0 (0.0%) missing  -> All genes were recognized by ClueGO.
#Genes with functional annotations in all selected Ontologies from Cluster#1: 141 (55.51%) -> 113 (44.49%) are not functionally annotated in any selected Ontology!
 -> To improve the % of annotated genes, chose additional ontologies.
