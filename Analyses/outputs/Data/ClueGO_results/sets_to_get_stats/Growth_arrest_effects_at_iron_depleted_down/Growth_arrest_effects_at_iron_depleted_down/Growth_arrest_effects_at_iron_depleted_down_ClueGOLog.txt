#Genes in custom reference set (C:\Users\34655\OneDrive\Desktop\reference.txt) : 2182
#All unique genes in selected ontologies: 2182 (reference set for hypergeometric test)

#Genes from Cluster#1: unique uploaded ids 1149 -> corresponding genes 1149, with 0 (0.0%) missing  -> All genes were recognized by ClueGO.
#Genes with functional annotations in all selected Ontologies from Cluster#1: 750 (65.27%) -> 399 (34.73%) are not functionally annotated in any selected Ontology!
 -> To improve the % of annotated genes, chose additional ontologies.

#Genes from all Clusters associated to 816 representative Terms and Pathways (after applying general selection criteria): 727 (63.27%)
#Genes from all Clusters associated to 540 representative Terms and Pathways (after fusion selection criteria): 724 (63.01%)
