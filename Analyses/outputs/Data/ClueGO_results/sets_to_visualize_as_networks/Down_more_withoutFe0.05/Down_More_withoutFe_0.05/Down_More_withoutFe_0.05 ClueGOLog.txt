#Genes in custom reference set (C:\Users\34655\OneDrive\Desktop\DRY LAB\ClueGo_C5-C6_final\Sogol\reference.txt) : 2182
#All unique genes in selected ontologies: 2182 (reference set for hypergeometric test)

#Genes from Cluster#1: unique uploaded ids 175 -> corresponding genes 175, with 0 (0.0%) missing  -> All genes were recognized by ClueGO.
#Genes with functional annotations in all selected Ontologies from Cluster#1: 133 (76.0%) -> 42 (24.0%) are not functionally annotated in any selected Ontology!
 -> To improve the % of annotated genes, chose additional ontologies.

#Genes from all Clusters associated to 199 representative Terms and Pathways (after applying general selection criteria): 131 (74.86%)
#Genes from all Clusters associated to 102 representative Terms and Pathways (after fusion selection criteria): 130 (74.29%)
